<p>I was originally going to use Sharpmake as the build system for the project, it is very powerful, fast, and easy for anyone who is familiar with programming since the configuration is done in C#. However, Iâ€™m currently running into issues with the most recent distribution and I didnâ€™t want to spend any more time debugging instead of working on the project. If the scope of the build system starts getting out of hand Iâ€™ll switch over and work through the issues, but for the sake of getting up and running ASAP weâ€™re going to use <strong>premake5</strong></p>
