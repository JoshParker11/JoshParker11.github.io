I"∆<h1 id="initial-project-setup">Initial Project Setup</h1>
<p>I was originally going to use <strong>Sharpmake</strong> as the build system for the project, it is very powerful, fast, and easy for anyone who is familiar with programming since the configuration is done in C#. However, I‚Äôm currently running into issues with the most recent distribution and I didn‚Äôt want to spend any more time debugging instead of working on the project. If the scope of the build system starts getting out of hand I‚Äôll switch over and work through the issues, but for the sake of getting up and running ASAP we‚Äôre going to use <strong>premake5</strong> for the time being, a more than capable build configuration manager, and my preferred system outside <strong>Sharpmake</strong>.</p>

<p>Follow this link: https://github.com/premake/premake-core/releases</p>

<p>Click the version you want to download, I‚Äôm using <strong>Premake 5.0-beta1</strong>

<p>This will download a zip file containing the executable we need.

<h2 id="setting-up-the-project">Setting up the project</h2>
<p>I have a specific way that I like to set up project, so I will explain using the file structure that I plan on using for this project, if you structure your projects differently no worries just slot things in where you need them and adjust file paths accordingly.</p>

<p>Basic structure for the project:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/premake_setup/proj_tree.png" alt="Project Structure" /></p>

<p>I‚Äôve moved the un-zipped premake5.exe under a directory called Vendor/bin/premake/ along with the LICENSE.txt</p>

<p>I‚Äôve also create a new file called <strong>premake5.lua</strong> <em>Premake looks for this file by name specifically so make sure it‚Äôs correct.</em></p>

<p><strong>premake5.lua</strong> is where we‚Äôll hold all our project configuration for now (this might get broken up into multiple files eventually).</p>

<p>You can look through the wiki on the github page or a slightly nicer version here: https://premake.github.io/docs/</p>

<p>I won‚Äôt be going into extreme depth as to how everything works, so feel free to pursue the docs and search for concepts that I didn‚Äôt cover. I would specifically look at (https://premake.github.io/docs/Tokens/#value-tokens) to see some predefined values.</p>

<h3 id="some-initial-tags-of-note">Some initial tags of note</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>workspace</strong> - Name of the solution that is generated</li>
  <li><strong>project</strong> - Name of a particular project (everything written under this will be a part of that project until another is specified or another variable is declared)</li>
  <li><strong>location</strong> - Name of folder to emit the main artifact to (.vcxproj, ‚Ä¶) <em>relative to the script file</em></li>
  <li><strong>files</strong> - Relative paths to the files that should be included in the project</li>
  <li><strong>targetdir</strong> - Output path of build artifacts (.lib, .pdb, ‚Ä¶)</li>
  <li><strong>objdir</strong> - Output path of intermediate build artifacts (.obj, .log, ‚Ä¶)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is some initial configuration that will create a solution called Engine with a project called Engine within it:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-lua" data-lang="lua"><span class="n">workspace</span> <span class="s2">"Engine"</span>

		<span class="s2">"%{prj.name}/src/**.cpp"</span>
	<span class="p">}</span>	</code></pre></figure>

<p>A couple of things to note; Since this is written in <strong>lua</strong> you can declare variables and use them like you would any other script, for us this is currently <em>outputdir</em> since we will use this format in multiple places it‚Äôs nice to pull that out into a variable for easy manipulation later and less code duplication. I‚Äôve also set up the core Engine project as a ‚ÄúStaticLib‚Äù, this means it will be built as a .lib which is the current architecture I have planned for the project. The core engine libraries will be statically linked to the game/editor projects, this may change in the future but for now is what I‚Äôm going with.</p>
