<p>I love making games! <br />
Telling your own story, bringing your imagination to life, creating new worlds for people discover and explore.<br />
But I also love understanding how things work, breaking them apart to see what lies beneath, and building my own version to affirm my understanding.<br />
So when I first began learning how to program (with the intention of pursuing a job in games), itâ€™s unsurprising that I gravitated towards game engines and understanding how a button press could make a character dance, or how I could see anything on the screen to begin with. The more Iâ€™ve learned over the years the further I want to dig. Iâ€™ve built several game engines in the past, but whenever a new project catches my attention I canâ€™t help but throw everything away and start again with the lessons Iâ€™ve learned and a fresh set of ideas. This however, is not conducive to building new games, since by the time Iâ€™ve rebuilt enough of the engine to get something working the spark has usually died out.</p>

<p>My intentions with documenting my adventures this time around are twofold; firstly, as engines like Unity and Unreal get better and better, I see fewer and fewer people pursuing the rigorous task of building the foundation themselves. This is entirely understandable given the time investment required to take on such a task and the very real possibility that too few people will see the end result to justify it. However, I would like to share any knowledge that Iâ€™ve gained and any I gain along the way, in the hopes that it will make the process easy enough so as not to dissuade anyone before theyâ€™ve begun. Also, many AAA game studios still use custom engines, so if you are reading this and intend on working at one eventually, an understanding of the architecture and underlying systems will serve you well. Secondly, I want to document this journey to reinforce my own understanding and as a way to motivate me to see it through to the end.</p>

<h1 id="series-overview">Series Overview</h1>

<p>The series is most likely going to be broken up into multiple stages, development of the core engine, building an editor to create content for the engine, and eventually building our own game. The game is TBD at the moment, thankfully the first two stages will provide ample time for brainstorming.</p>
