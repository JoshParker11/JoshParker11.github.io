<p>Hello again! Iâ€™m taking a brief detour from my originally planned sequence because I felt like talking about containers today, and the first one thatâ€™s important for the engine is a dynamic array. In general, I try to use static arrays whenever possible, but for convenience and learning I wanted to add a dynamic array implementation.</p>

<p><em>Note: This is just one implementation, it is by no means the best way to do it, this is just what works for me.</em></p>

<p>You might be wondering why I would bother writing a container from scratch when things like std::vector exist. There are two main reasons, one, I want to learn as much as possible so reinventing/reimplementing the wheel is the name of the game. Two, I want as few external dependencies as reasonably possible, and as much control over how my code interacts with the metal as I can. The dependencies Iâ€™m trying to avoid include the STL.</p>
