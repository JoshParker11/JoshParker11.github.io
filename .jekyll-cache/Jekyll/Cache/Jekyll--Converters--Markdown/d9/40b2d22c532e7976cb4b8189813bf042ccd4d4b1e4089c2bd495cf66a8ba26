<p>I was originally going to use <strong>Sharpmake</strong> as the build system for the project, it is very powerful, fast, and easy for anyone who is familiar with programming since the configuration is done in C#. However, I’m currently running into issues with the most recent distribution and I didn’t want to spend any more time debugging instead of working on the project. If the scope of the build system starts getting out of hand I’ll switch over and work through the issues, but for the sake of getting up and running ASAP we’re going to use <strong>premake5</strong> for the time being, a more than capable build configuration manager, and my preferred system outside <strong>Sharpmake</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-project">Setting up the project</h2>
<p>I have a specific way that I like to set up project, so I will explain using the file structure that I plan on using for this project, if you structure your projects differently no worries just slot things in where you need them and adjust file paths accordingly.</p>

<p>Basic structure for the project:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/premake_setup/proj_tree.png" alt="Project Structure" /></p>

<p>I’ve moved the un-zipped premake5.exe under a directory called Vendor/bin/premake/ along with the LICENSE.txt</p>

<p>I’ve also create a new file called <strong>premake5.lua</strong> <em>Premake looks for this file by name specifically so make sure it’s correct.</em></p>

<p><strong>premake5.lua</strong> is where we’ll hold all our project configuration for now (this might get broken up into multiple files eventually).</p>
