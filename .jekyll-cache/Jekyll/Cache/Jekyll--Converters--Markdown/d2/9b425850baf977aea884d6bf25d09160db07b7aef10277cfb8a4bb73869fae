I"—<p>I love making games! <br />
Telling your own story, bringing your imagination to life, creating new worlds for people discover and explore.<br />
But I also love understanding how things work, breaking them apart to see what lies beneath, and building my own version to affirm my understanding.<br />
So when I first began learning how to program with the intention of pursuing a job creating games, itâ€™s unsurprising that I gravitated towards game engines and understanding how a button press could make a character dance, or how I could see anything on the screen to begin with. The more Iâ€™ve learned over the years the larger my excitmentâ€™s grown</p>
