<p>There have been many times since I started my programming journey where it’s been made obvious to me how significant the hardware is to the programs we write. Being that all code is essentially a sequence of data transformations, the most important part of writing something that runs efficiently is having an understanding of what that data is, and precisely what we want to do with it. To figure out the best way to transform the data, one would imagine that knowing what is physically possible on a given piece of hardware would be a useful bit of information.</p>

<p>I have a general sense of things that helpful and harmful to this endeavor, but I’m nowhere near the level I’d like to be at. I stumbled upon an amazing <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">website</a>/course</p>
